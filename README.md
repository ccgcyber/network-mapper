# network-mapper
Network mapper is a dynamic discovery and mapping tool that helps network administrators to visualize their complete network infrastructure with a live network map. Whenever a device is added in the network(manually), then it will be shown automatically.  A message will be generated whenever a link is down. An entry of every device's network activity is maintained in a log file for the network administrator.
